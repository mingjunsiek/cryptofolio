### A portfolio app for your crypto assets

CryptoFolio is a mobile application for anyone who wants to have more control of their crypto assets allocation.

I created this app as a side project for me to test out Flutter as well as the CoinGecko API.

You can download this repository and run this on your phone. Currently this is configured for Android devices.
